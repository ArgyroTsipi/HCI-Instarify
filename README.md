## Key Features:

**Instagram Templates**: The app allows users to choose from a collection of pre-designed Instagram templates. These templates cover various themes and styles, making it convenient for users to create eye-catching content for their social media accounts.

**Customization Options**: Users have the flexibility to customize the templates by adding their own photos(**open camera/system folder/upload file**), draw, and other creative elements. This enables them to craft unique and personalized posts that align with their individual tastes and preferences.

**Seamless Image Search**: With integration to the **Unsplash API**, users can access an extensive library of high-quality images. The app's search bar allows users to find specific images, explore different categories, and discover visuals that resonate with their content.

**Suggestion System**: The app goes a step further in enhancing the user experience by implementing a suggestion system. Based on users' previous choices, interactions, and content preferences, the app intelligently **recommends templates and image options that align with their interests**. This helps users discover new ideas and styles that they might not have considered, enriching their creative process.

**Rating System**: Each template in the app comes with a built-in rating system. Users can rate templates based on their experience and how well the templates have performed on their Instagram posts. This feature enables users to provide feedback and helps others in the community to identify the most popular and well-received templates.
